# Another Chat App (ACA)
A true **P2P** private instant messaging app written in Rust.

## Features
- **End-to-end encrypted**.
- **True P2P**: no central servers, no bootstrap nodes.
- **No timestamps**: less metadata for the glowies.
- **Limited chat history in the GUI**L only a small portion of chat history is visible, giving less context to onlookers.

## Technical Details
The chat app works by creating a Tor onion service and communicating with peers through WebSockets.  
The first message is sent after a handshake where nodes exchange their public keys.  

- Public/private keys: **Curve25519 elliptic curve Diffieâ€“Hellman (ECDH)**  
- Message encryption and authentication: **XSalsa20 stream cipher + Poly1305 MAC**

## Security Considerations

ACA is experimental software. While it uses strong cryptographic primitives, there are important limitations:

- **Forward Secrecy**:  
  Messages are encrypted with long-term key pairs. If a private key is ever compromised, past messages could be decrypted. Forward secrecy (e.g., via ephemeral session keys) is not yet implemented.

- **Replay Attacks**:  
  The protocol does not currently include replay protection. An adversary could resend valid ciphertexts to trick clients into displaying old messages.

- **Metadata Exposure**:  
  While message contents are encrypted, Tor onion addresses and traffic patterns may still reveal who is talking to whom and when.

- **Key Authentication**:  
  Keys are exchanged directly between peers. Without an out-of-band verification method (fingerprints, QR codes, etc.), there is a risk of man-in-the-middle attacks.

- **Denial of Service (DoS)**:  
  No built-in rate limiting or resource controls exist, making nodes vulnerable to flooding or connection exhaustion.

- **Limited Audit**:  
  The codebase has not undergone a professional security audit. Use at your own risk.
