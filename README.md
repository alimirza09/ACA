# Another Chat App (ACA)
A true **P2P** private instant messaging app written in Rust.

## Features ‚ú®
- **End-to-end encryption**  
- **True P2P**: no central servers, no bootstrap nodes  
- **No timestamps**: less metadata for the glowies  
- **Limited chat history in the GUI**: only a small portion of chat history is visible, reducing context available to onlookers  

## Technical Details ü•±
ACA works by creating a Tor onion service and communicating with peers through WebSockets.  
The first message is sent after a handshake where peers exchange their public keys.  

- **Public/private keys**: Curve25519 elliptic-curve Diffie‚ÄìHellman (ECDH)  
- **Message encryption & authentication**: XSalsa20 stream cipher with Poly1305 MAC  

## Security Considerations üîí

‚ö†Ô∏è **ACA is experimental software. Do not rely on it for secure communications.**  

While ACA uses strong cryptographic primitives, there are important limitations:

- **Forward Secrecy**  
  Messages are encrypted with long-term key pairs. If a private key is ever compromised, past messages could be decrypted. Forward secrecy (e.g., via ephemeral session keys) is not yet implemented.

- **Replay Attacks**  
  The protocol does not currently include replay protection. An adversary could potentially resend valid ciphertexts to trick clients into displaying old messages.  
  Mitigations such as nonces or sequence numbers are not yet implemented.

- **Metadata Exposure**  
  While message contents are encrypted, Tor onion addresses and traffic patterns may still reveal who is talking to whom and when.

- **Key Authentication**  
  Keys are exchanged directly between peers. Without an out-of-band verification method (fingerprints, QR codes, etc.), there is a risk of man-in-the-middle attacks.

- **Denial of Service (DoS)**  
  No built-in rate limiting or resource controls exist, making nodes vulnerable to flooding or connection exhaustion.

- **Limited Audit**  
  The codebase has not undergone a professional security audit. Use at your own risk.
